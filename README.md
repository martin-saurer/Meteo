# Meteo

Meteo is a small tool to analyze Swiss weather data (rain / temperature) from the years 1864-2013.

It is fully implemented in the J programming language. To run the application, please download the J software suitable for your platform.

The weather data records based on [Swiss Open Data Records](http://opendata.admin.ch).

The main part of the program such as reading interptreting filtering the data, as well as calculating the linear regression for temperature and rain values is just 30 lines of J code. All the rest is GUI related stuff.

###Have fun!
